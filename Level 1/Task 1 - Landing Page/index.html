            <h2 class="belowheading">How do you choose a laptop computer?</h2>
            <p>By their very nature, laptops are designed to be portable. A 15.6-inch screen size is standard in most laptops, but smaller screen sizes 12 to 14-inch laptop - make a laptop more portable. <br> This is also the size that's preferred by most: no matter whether you're a student or a working professional. <br> However, gamers and content creators seek higher specs and faster processors to keep up with their usage. <br>   The display also plays an important role when choosing a laptop. Several laptops offer a 4K resolution, with Full-HD and HD-Ready options. <br> Selecting the right one is crucial since you'll likely be staring at it for almost the entire day. Operating Systems or OS are also crucial since the user experience in the three major systems - Mac, Windows, and Chrome - vastly differs. </p>
